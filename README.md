## 🚀 About This Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website built with **SvelteKit**, featuring a modern and responsive design. The website showcases my projects, skills, and provides information about my background and experience. 

I chose this particular framework to get experience on something that I wouldn't have had the opportunity to try in production projects.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)** - The web framework for building the portfolio
- **TypeScript** - For type-safe development
- **Vite** - For fast development and building
- **GitHub Pages** - For hosting and deployment
